                          <li>We designed and built EHXE, an innovative app that allows you to visualise your stories and experiences in a new way. Using geolocation, you can add words, photos, and sounds to capture and map your memories and experiences. EHXE was built by CJ Ponti, Andrea Kennedy and James Poulter.</li>

              <p>We've outlined the benefits of working with Lost Robots in our <a class="about_section" href="#" data-target="section-1" on-click="return false">about section above</a>, but here's a bit more about how we work together.</p>

              <p>Throughout our development process, we use the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">agile approach</a>, constantly iterating through each stage of client liaison, project planning, prototyping, designing, developing, and testing. This keeps you informed and encourages constant corrections to make sure we're headed down the right track to producing the most accurate and highest quality product.</p>

              <p>We use a mixture of technologies and select the best ones to suit each project. Our favourite go-tos are <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, HTML5/CSS, mobile-first development, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design. We also build full test-suites for our projects to ensure security and reliability in our work.</p>

              <p>Finally, we can perform the following tasks for every project:</p>
